# Comparative-Performance-Analysis-of-Apache-Spark-and-Hadoop-MapReduce-on-ML-Algorithms
We try to compare the performances of Spark and Mapreduce using machine learning algorithms.They are compared using few metrics such as runtime, memory usage, network usage and CPU efficiency.  Performances are observed using monitoring and visualizing tools Prometheus and Grafana.
